# ANDROID BASIC QUIZ

Introduction
-----------------
Android Basic Quiz as the name implies is an app that features Ten (10) Questions on Basic Android
Knowledge. The questions are comprised of Three (3) basic input formats thus:
•	Single Choice: is composed of three options questions from which the user is allowed to make a choice from the list of options. ONLY one of the three options holds the correct answer to the question.
•	Multiple Choice: is composed of three options questions from which the user is allowed to make a minimum of one choice and a maximum of two choices from the list of options. ONLY one or two of the three options hold(s) the correct answer(s) to the question.
•	Text Input: displays an input field where the user is expected to type in the correct answer to the question.

Scoring
----------
Before a valid submission can be made, the user is expected to attempt all questions. Each question attracts Ten percent (10%); hence ten correct answers implies a 100% quiz score. On complete attempt of the ten questions, the user clicks on the submit button for result processing. This displays the user’s score on the navigation bar. Similarly, a voice feedback is gotten depending on the range of score thus:
•	Score 0% - 45%: a disappointing voice saying, “No! That’s not gonna do it”.
•	Score 50% - 75%: an encouraging voice saying, “You’re almost there”.
•	Score 80% - 95%: an encouraging applause for a job well done.
•	Score 100%: an outburst from a surprised voice exclaiming, “Unbelievable!”

Other Functionalities
-----------------------------
Aside the “Submit” button, the app also provides other buttons for better functionalities. This can be seen in:
•	Reset: enables the user the ability to clear selected options and resets the score to 0%.
•	Show Answers: enables the user who doesn’t know the right answers the ability to see the correct answers to the questions. These are highlighted in orange color.
•	Take Quiz: as seen on the home screen, provides a functionality alongside the input field which allows the user the ability to enter a desired username. This is captured from the home screen and displayed with a welcome note on the quiz screen.
